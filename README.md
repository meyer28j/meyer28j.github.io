## Assignment 3 Changes

This assignment changed many of the flexbox/CSS grid structures as needed. In many places, flexbox was introduced to simply center content or line up one or two elements in a row. 

Media queries were added for tablet and desktop view. Much of the "work" done to make the desktop view look nice is done in the tablet breakpoint CSS but with overflow allowed so for some sections no extra code was needed for the desktop breakpoint.

Some content still does not match the wireframes as many of the content was shuffled around when moving everything to one page.

### Browser Testing

This webpage was tested on:
1. Firefox
2. Brave (Chromium)

No issues were seen.

## Assignment 2 Changes

1. All pages combined to reduce content amount
    - resulted in a mashup of original leader-content from homepage wireframe with content on each individual page wireframe
    - 

2. Instead of hiding sidebar on mobile, use it to replace the "Here's my resume" sections
    - effectively the same thing, but sidebar includes extra content not present in the "Here's my resume" sections
