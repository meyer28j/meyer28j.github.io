1. All pages combined to reduce content amount
    - resulted in a mashup of original leader-content from homepage wireframe with content on each individual page wireframe
    - The skills and experience sections still need to be configured to match the wireframe layout

2. Instead of hiding sidebar on mobile, use it to replace the "Here's my resume" sections
    - effectively the same thing, but sidebar includes extra content not present in the "Here's my resume" sections
