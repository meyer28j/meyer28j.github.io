1. All pages combined to reduce content amount
    - resulted in a mashup of original leader-content from homepage wireframe with content on each individual page wireframe

2. Instead of hiding sidebar on mobile, use it to replace the "Here's my resume" sections
    - effectively the same thing, but sidebar includes extra content
